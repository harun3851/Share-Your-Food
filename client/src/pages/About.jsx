Every year, 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally. That's one-third of all the food produced for human consumption.

At the same time, 828 million people do not have enough to eat. That's 1 in 10 people on the planet.

Food waste is a major contributor to hunger and food insecurity. It also has a significant impact on the environment.

We encourage people to share their food with those in need. We also work to raise awareness of the issue of food waste and promote sustainable food production.
